# Step 2 &mdash; The API Layer

There is now a functional database with a live model. The next thing to do it to write an API to access that model.

## What's an API

## The Books API

install express
installing nodemon

get /books
get /books/:id
post /books (json payload)
  body parser
  validations:
    show validations in request
    show validations in middleware

put /books/:id (json)
delete /books/:id

- ensure json payload (middleware)
- validate json payload for post
### write the api


### test the api with curl

### test the api with postman

### switch to web application
